# Institutional Position Unwinding Strategies

This module implements sophisticated position unwinding strategies used by large institutional traders to safely offload large positions without causing significant market impact.

## Overview

When institutional traders need to exit large positions, they can't simply submit market orders as this would cause significant price impact and poor execution quality. Instead, they use advanced execution algorithms that:

- **Minimize Market Impact**: Break large orders into smaller pieces
- **Optimize Timing**: Execute when liquidity is available
- **Hide Intentions**: Use stealth techniques to avoid detection
- **Balance Risk**: Trade off market impact vs. timing risk
- **Maximize Efficiency**: Achieve best execution across venues

## Available Strategies

### 1. TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price)
**Best for**: Stable markets with predictable volume patterns

Spreads execution evenly across a specified time horizon to minimize timing risk.

```python
cerebro.addstrategy(
    PositionUnwindingStrategy,
    unwind_method="twap",
    time_horizon=240,  # 4 hours
    max_participation_rate=0.15,
    stealth_mode=True
)
```

**Key Features**:
- Linear execution rate
- Predictable completion time
- Low market impact in stable markets
- Good for time-sensitive unwinding

### 2. VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price)
**Best for**: Markets with strong intraday volume patterns

Executes proportional to historical volume patterns to minimize market impact.

```python
cerebro.addstrategy(
    PositionUnwindingStrategy,
    unwind_method="vwap",
    max_participation_rate=0.20,
    liquidity_buffer=0.25
)
```

**Key Features**:
- Follows natural market rhythm
- Higher execution during high-volume periods
- Adapts to market liquidity
- Excellent for liquid stocks

### 3. Iceberg Orders
**Best for**: Very large orders in liquid markets

Hides order size by only showing small portions to the market.

```python
cerebro.addstrategy(
    PositionUnwindingStrategy,
    unwind_method="iceberg",
    iceberg_show_size=0.08,  # Show only 8%
    stealth_mode=True
)
```

**Key Features**:
- Conceals true order size
- Prevents front-running
- Reduces adverse selection
- Good for very large positions

### 4. Implementation Shortfall
**Best for**: Volatile markets with timing constraints

Balances market impact costs against timing risk using quantitative optimization.

```python
cerebro.addstrategy(
    PositionUnwindingStrategy,
    unwind_method="is",
    risk_factor=0.6,  # 0=aggressive, 1=conservative
    volatility_threshold=0.02
)
```

**Key Features**:
- Mathematically optimal execution
- Adapts to market volatility
- Minimizes total implementation cost
- Best for sophisticated traders

### 5. Adaptive Execution
**Best for**: All market conditions (recommended)

Uses machine learning and real-time market analysis for dynamic optimization.

```python
cerebro.addstrategy(
    PositionUnwindingStrategy,
    unwind_method="adaptive",
    dark_pool_preference=0.8,
    stealth_mode=True
)
```

**Key Features**:
- Real-time market analysis
- Dynamic participation rates
- Multi-venue optimization
- Continuous learning and adaptation

## Execution Profiles

The strategy includes pre-configured execution profiles for different scenarios:

### Conservative Profile
- **Use case**: Risk-averse unwinding, large positions
- **Time horizon**: 8+ hours
- **Participation rate**: 3-10% of volume
- **Stealth mode**: Enabled
- **Dark pool preference**: 90%

### Aggressive Profile  
- **Use case**: Fast unwinding, time-sensitive
- **Time horizon**: 2 hours
- **Participation rate**: 10-30% of volume
- **Stealth mode**: Disabled
- **Market impact**: Higher but faster completion

### Stealth Profile
- **Use case**: Maximum concealment, avoid detection
- **Time horizon**: 12+ hours  
- **Participation rate**: 2-8% of volume
- **Randomization**: Maximum
- **Dark pool preference**: 90%

## Risk Management Features

### Circuit Breakers
The strategy automatically pauses execution when:
- Volatility spikes above threshold (default 2%)
- Volume drops below liquidity buffer (default 30%)
- Adverse price movements occur (default 3%)

### Emergency Liquidation
Automatic emergency exit when:
- Position loss exceeds threshold (default 10%)
- Market conditions deteriorate severely
- Completion risk becomes too high

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from algos.position_unwinding.strategy import PositionUnwindingStrategy

# Add to your Backtrader cerebro
cerebro.addstrategy(
    PositionUnwindingStrategy,
    unwind_method="adaptive",
    target_position=0,  # Full unwind
    time_horizon=240,   # 4 hours
    stealth_mode=True
)
```

### Advanced Configuration
```python
# Customize for your specific needs
cerebro.addstrategy(
    PositionUnwindingStrategy,
    unwind_method="vwap",
    target_position=5000,      # Partial unwind to 5000 shares
    max_participation_rate=0.15,
    min_participation_rate=0.05,
    volatility_threshold=0.025,
    liquidity_buffer=0.35,
    max_order_value=25000,
    dark_pool_preference=0.7,
    stealth_mode=True
)
```

## Execution Analytics

Track and analyze execution quality with comprehensive metrics:

```python
from algos.position_unwinding.execution_analytics import ExecutionAnalytics

analytics = ExecutionAnalytics()
# ... add fills ...
report = analytics.generate_execution_report("AAPL")
```

### Available Metrics
- **Implementation Shortfall**: Total execution cost breakdown
- **Market Impact**: Price impact of your trades
- **Timing Cost**: Opportunity cost of delayed execution
- **Participation Rate**: % of market volume consumed  
- **Slippage**: Execution price vs. reference price
- **Venue Analysis**: Performance across different venues

## Best Practices

### 1. Choose the Right Algorithm
- **Stable markets**: TWAP or VWAP
- **Volatile markets**: Implementation Shortfall or Adaptive
- **Very large orders**: Iceberg or Stealth profile
- **Time-sensitive**: Aggressive profile
- **Risk-averse**: Conservative profile

### 2. Parameter Tuning
- **Participation rate**: Start conservative (5-15%)
- **Time horizon**: Allow adequate time (4-8 hours typical)
- **Volatility threshold**: Adjust based on asset volatility
- **Stealth mode**: Enable for large/sensitive positions

### 3. Market Conditions
- **Avoid earnings/events**: Higher volatility and impact
- **Use market hours**: Better liquidity and pricing
- **Monitor news flow**: Pause during major news
- **Check correlations**: Consider portfolio-level impact

### 4. Venue Selection
- **Dark pools**: 40-70% for large orders
- **Primary exchange**: 20-40% for price discovery
- **ECNs**: 10-30% for additional liquidity
- **Avoid predictable patterns**: Randomize venue selection
